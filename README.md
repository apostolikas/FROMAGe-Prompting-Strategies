This repository contains the implementation of the FROMAGe model as proposed in the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.13823.pdf). The code was obtained after cloning the author's github [repo](https://github.com/kohjingyu/fromage) and the purpose of this repository is to explore the possibilities for in-context learning of FROMAGe, by working with different prompting templates and strategies.
