# Description

This repository contains the implementation of the FROMAGe model as proposed in the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.13823.pdf). The code was obtained after cloning the author's github [repo](https://github.com/kohjingyu/fromage) and the purpose of this repository is to explore the possibilities for in-context learning of FROMAGe, by working with different prompting templates and strategies. 

# Instructions

The blogpost.md provides a mini report of the strategies and the experiments conducted in this work. It also contains the results and a discussion of them. 
For your convenience, there are also some demos in the demos folder where you can run them and get a first experience of how the model works in each task and how some augmentations might actually help it perform even better.

Before you run anything, it is very important to follow the steps below:
1. Download the Flickr-8k dataset from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wkQAqNnIPPijeKgyCUEDtWa56OFkugEY?usp=sharing), unzip and put the 2 folders inside the main directory of the project.
2. Download the Guided-vqa dataset from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wkQAqNnIPPijeKgyCUEDtWa56OFkugEY?usp=sharing), unzip and put the folder inside the main directory of the project.
3. Make sure to install the environment before running any script.
4. Run the demos and explore the FROMAGe's potential on several tasks.
